    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Marinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize the meat and adds just the right amount
        of flavor. Some top-quality steaks can go without a marinade, since they're already full of meaty flavor and,
        with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade. Budget-friendly steaks, however,
        benefit tremendously from marination. You'll be shocked at the difference a good marinade makes! </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make homemade steak marinade — you may already have most of the ingredients you'll need:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>

        <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
