        <h2 class="heading2">Description</h2>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Marinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize the meat and adds just the right amount
            of flavor. Some top-quality steaks can go without a marinade, since they're already full of meaty flavor and,
            with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade. Budget-friendly steaks, however,
            benefit tremendously from marination. You'll be shocked at the difference a good marinade makes! </p>
